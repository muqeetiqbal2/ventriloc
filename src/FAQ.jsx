    question: "How do you ensure a high adoption rate for your solutions?",
    answer: "Our data value experts all have strong business and technical knowledge. They are able to speak the same language as the end users and involve them quickly in the solution design process. Real emphasis is placed on user experience and interface (UX/UI) with all components developed in the analytics solution. By implementing analytics interfaces that focus on data storytelling and optimized integration pipelines for maintenance, this is how we foster adoption!"

  {
    question: "What is your approach when starting a new initiative?",
    answer: "When we develop a new initiative with a partner, we always favor a risk-reducing approach. We always propose to start with an 'iteration 0' where we target a specific project that can be completed in a few weeks and quickly bring value to our partner. This way, we learn to work as a team quickly and get to know the business context well. Once our experts have mastered the business context, we can advise and accurately estimate the effort required to implement a complete analytics solution that truly meets business needs."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with partners of all sizes?",
    answer: "Absolutely! We adapt to each of our partners in our approach and in the solutions we offer. We are always ready to solve new challenges and support our partners in choosing solutions tailored to their business situation."
  },
  {
    question: "Are the solutions you implement hosted in your environments?",
    answer: "Never. Your data, your analytics infrastructure, your reports, your integration flows, or any artifacts of your solution are never hosted in our environments. For the sake of transparency and security for your organization, we ensure that we develop solutions that you own and control."
